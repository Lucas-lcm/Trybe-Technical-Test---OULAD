I am the Data Analyst who did the analysis for the business team

The University's learning team wants to understand:
(i) What is the profile of the people who are students;
(ii) What are the factors related to people's performance; and;
(iii) What recommendations/initiatives would you suggest to improve their performance?

The job is to explore the data and drive business decision making
